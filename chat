@ppirx Your margins are inflating the size of the grid

Matthais
:
Note how I've tidied up some of your selectors.  You were using classes like IDs
[

Matthais
:
and your grid positioning could be tidied up a lot.  Really you only need to define the display and the equals button as they span multiple cells
[

Matthais
:
as long as your elements are in the correct order in HTML the result will populate

Matthais

@ppirx Okay, tidied up the grid placements, refresh again

Matthais

flex box!? i scared just got confidnet with grid somehow
[

Matthais
:
Grid can be used for both 2d (like the calculator) or 1d (a column or row) layouts, while flexbox is just for the latter.  I just find flexbox quicker in some respects

:
I could tidy up your CSS a lot more for redundancy if I had more time: look for places where the same handful of styles are repeated (I'm guilty of having done that with my flexboxes) and either combine with selectors, or even add a new class, like I did with .oper & .num
